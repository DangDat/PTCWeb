Capability development

The Peter Cullen Trustâ€™s unique Science to Policy Leadership Program focuses on leadership and communication skills specifically geared towards bringing about positive change in water and catchment management in Australia.

Sponsoring a program participant means having a member of your own organisation trained and granted a Fellowship on successful completion of the program.

This will benefit your organisation because, as these key staff members enhance their skills, they will share what they have learnt and build relationships across the water/environment sector.

As a sponsoring employer, you can put forward potential participants from your teams, building organisational capacity by developing key people in key positions.

Capacity-building benefits to the sponsored Fellow after the program are the same as to all Fellows:

Professional development
Mentoring by Friends of the Peter Cullen Trust who are Australian leaders
Opportunities to publish
Opportunities to apply for small collaborative project funding through the Trust
Opportunities to speak at conferences
Networking opportunities at events with guest speakers
