The Peter Cullen Trust Science to Policy Leadership Program

The Peter Cullen Trust offers organisations the opportunity to sponsor a limited number of participants on the Science to Policy Leadership Program. This unique program is specifically geared towards enhancing positive work in water and catchment management, policy and practice across Australia.

This is your opportunity to participate in an established, proven and respected program, allowing your organisation to demonstrate commitment to sustainability whilst building capacity and raising your profile.

Sponsors typically nominate candidates who are an asset to their organisation. Sponsored participants are usually mid career ‘rising stars’ whose professional development is an astute investment for the sponsoring organisation. The Trust targets passionate, intelligent, motivated people, with a history of success.
