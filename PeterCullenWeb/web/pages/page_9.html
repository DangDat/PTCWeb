					<p>This brochure and video are products of the project completed by the 2012 Fellows. "The choice of topic was particularly influenced by the continued national interest in the economic development of Northern Australia. The regions significant potential for development is likely to drive demand for and potentially increase risks to the region's water resources".</p>

					<p>This is the 2011 Fellows final report. "An opportunity exists now to strenthen policy frameworks to investigate and ensure the long-term benefits of CSG for Australia. A collaborative approach between all tiers of government is required. Getting this right will provide a legacy for effective resource management both now and into the future".</p>
